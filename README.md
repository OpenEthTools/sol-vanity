# SOL-Vanity

High-performance Solana vanity address generator — fully **client‑side**, accelerated with low‑level **WebAssembly + SIMD** routines for near‑native GPU‑like performance.

## Try it live

**[solvanity.io](https://www.solvanity.io/)** — Free forever, runs entirely in your browser.

## What is this?

Generate custom Solana addresses with specific prefixes or suffixes in seconds.  
Want an address starting with `sol` or ending with `moon`? Easy.

Unlike traditional GPU miners, everything happens **locally** on your device using a highly‑optimized WASM engine. No keys ever leave your machine.

## Security

- 100% client‑side — keys are never transmitted
- Hardened WASM assembly loops
- Deterministic generation based on the solana-keypair format
- Open source — verify everything yourself

## Performance

Our optimized WebAssembly engine delivers:

- **~250–350 MH/s** on high‑end consumer CPUs
- 4–5 character patterns in **seconds**
- 6–7 characters in **under a minute**
- Uses multithreading + SIMD acceleration through WASM

Performance varies by browser and CPU instruction set (AVX2 / AVX‑512 where available).

## Stack

- **Engine**: C++ → WebAssembly (SIMD enabled)
- **Worker**: Web Workers for parallel brute‑force scanning
- **Frontend**: Next.js/React
- **Infrastructure**: Static CDN — no backend required

## Why this exists

Most vanity tools rely on GPU miners, CLIs or remote servers. We wanted something:

- Instant
- Secure
- Zero trust
- Accessible on any machine

So we built a WASM assembly‑accelerated brute‑forcer that runs in the browser at near‑native speed.
